# BARK BLINKS API EXAMPLES

These API routes provide the basic functionality for creating and managing Blinks, SPL tokens, and performing token swaps. Note that these implementations are simplified and would need to be expanded and secured for a production environment. In particular:

1. User authentication and authorization should be implemented.
2. The dummy keypairs should be replaced with actual user wallets.
3. Error handling should be more robust.
4. Input validation should be more thorough.
5. The swap functionality would need to integrate with an actual decentralized exchange.
6. Proper metadata handling and storage solutions should be implemented for Blinks and SPL tokens.

Remember to update your environment (.env) variables and ensure that you're using the correct Solana network (devnet for testing, mainnet-beta for production) in your RPC endpoint.
